    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Biryani is a mixed rice dish that was thought to have originated from Iran before settling in
        modern India. It is made with rice, some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, or fish) and spices.
        To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables for the meat. Sometimes
        eggs and/or potatoes are added.

        Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia, as well as among the diaspora from the region. Similar
        dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.
        Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been
        labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.
