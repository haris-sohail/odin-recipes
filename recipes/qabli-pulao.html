    <h2 class="sub-heading">Description</h2>

    <p>Kabuli pulao (Dari: قابلی پلو, also transcribed as Kabuli pulaw or Qabeli palaw, Pashto: کابلي پلاو‎ Kabeli
        palaw) is a variety of pilaf made in Afghanistan.</p>

    <p>The core ingredients are steamed rice mixed with caramelized carrots and raisins as well as marinated lamb meat.
        Qabeli Palaw is commonly garnished with almonds and pistachios. Saffron may be added to either the rice, the
        sauce or the garnishes. Varieties of Qabeli pulao have spread from Afghanistan to different parts of Western and
        Central Asia.</p>

    <h2 class="sub-heading">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="steps">Make the broth: Place halved onion, garlic head, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, pepper, cumin
            seed, salt,
            sugar, paprika, coriander seeds, and cloves into a pressure cooker. Pour in water to cover.</li>

        <li class="steps">Close the cooker securely and place the pressure regulator over the vent according to
            manufacturer's
            instructions. Set to high and heat until steam escapes in a steady flow and makes a whistling sound, about 5
            minutes. Reduce to medium and cook for 20 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally, about 10 minutes.
            Unlock the lid and remove.</li>

        <li class="steps">When the broth is almost finished, start the rice: Soak rice in cool water for 5 minutes, then
            rinse until
            water runs clear.</li>

        <li class="steps">Strain cooled broth into a bowl. Clean out the pressure cooker, then place over medium heat
            and add oil.
        </li>

        <li class="steps">Add onion and garlic to the cooker; cook and stir until softened and browned, 7 to 10 minutes.
            Stir in
            carrots and cook until soft, about 3 minutes more. Add strained rice, raisins, almonds, cumin seed, pepper,
            cardamom powder, and clove. Stir to combine, then pour in enough broth to cover.</li>

        <li class="steps">Close the cooker securely and seal the vent; set to high and heat until the first whistle, 5
            to 7 minutes.
            Reduce to medium and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let rest for 7 minutes, then let pressure
            release naturally, about 10 minutes. Immediately transfer cooked rice to a serving dish to prevent
            overcooking.</li>
    </ol>
